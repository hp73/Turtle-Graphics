Project 7 - Turtle Graphics
CSCI 101 Fall 2018
By Harry Pinkerton and Justin Park
Required to run: python 3.7

=======================
koch.py
=======================
This program produces a koch snowflake given a level for the turtle to draw. Examples 
of the first 3 snowflakes (0,1,2) have been provided as .jps in this repository.
To run this program, simply call python3 koch.py followed by the level. For example, 
the first snowflake will be "python3 koch.py 0".

=======================
mondrian.py
=======================
This program displays a Mondrian-like painting with 
the user's input level.  The program obtains the level 
from a command-line argument.  Thus, python3 mondrian.py 6
draws a painting at level 6.

=======================
turtleexamples.py
=======================
defines some functions to draw geometric shapes in turtle graphics. Comment out sections of the main function within turtleexamples.py to isolate certain images.
By default, this program draws all images ontop of one another
